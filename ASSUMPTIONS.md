# Data relationships
- The admins themselves are employees
- Employees can have the same name but must have unique ID
- Removing an employee may still require data to be preserved for integrity purposes (reviews, feedback)
- Review/feedback is in free text form
- An employee can have multiple performance reviews
- An employee can be assigned to give feedback on many others
